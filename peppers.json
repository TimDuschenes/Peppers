In 2015 a friend of Peter’s gave him some seeds of a very large Jalapeno type that he had been growing a few years. He told Peter that he believed an Ancho Mulato type accidently crossed into it in his garden. The result was an extra large mild Jalapeno that ripened brown. The Brown Jalapeno have a smoky sweet flavor with mild heat. The smokiness is very subtle in the background. The Brown Jalapeno peppers are over an inch in width and average 4 to 6 inches long. They are ideal for stuffing, roasting and sauces.”",
